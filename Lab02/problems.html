CMPUT 201 (A1) Lab Exercise 2

Due: Friday Sep 28, 22:00 via eClass

Rules:

- You can use all course material and man pages, but no other information such
  as web pages, books, or written notes. Using other information sources
  during the exercise constitues cheating

- Your programs must compile without warning using

  g++ -Wall -Wextra -O ...

  on our lab machines. If there are compiler warnings or errors, there will be
  considerable mark deductions

- Test your programs with different values. For now, the speed of your program
  is irrelevant. So don't spend time on optimization

- Your programs must be well structured. Use ctrl-x t in Emacs to pretty-print
  it. Marks are assigned to functionality and program appearance

- In case your program hangs, use ctrl-c to terminate it

- Download README.txt and fill in the requested information

- Submit             README.txt p1.c p2.c p3.c p4.c
  by the due date

- You can submit as often as you want. We will only consider the last
  submission for marking.

============================================================================

1) [8 marks] In file p1.c write a function called power 

                   y
    that computes x  for two parameters: double x and unsigned int y
              
    We define x⁰ = 1 for all x

    In function main() provide code to test your function.
    You can't use functions from math.h

============================================================================

2) [8 marks] In file p2.c write a RECURSIVE function called 
   is_power_of_2 that returns true if and only if a given
   unsigned int x parameter is an integer power of 2

   E.g.  is_power_of_2(16) = true
         is_power_of_2(17) = false

   In function main() provide code to test your function.
   You can't use functions from math.h

============================================================================

3) [8 marks] In file p3.c write a function called iterated_digit_sum that
   computes the sum of base-10 digits of a given unsigned int x and repeats
   that computation for the result until the value doesn't change anymore

    Examples:   iterated_digit_sum(0)     = 0
                iterated_digit_sum(26)    = 8
                iterated_digit_sum(11111) = 5
                iterated_digit_sum(22222) = 1

   In function main() provide code to test your function
   You can't use functions from math.h

============================================================================

4) [8 marks] In file p4.c write a function called myexp 

                      x
   that approximates e , where e is Euler's constant (2.718281...) and
   x is a double floating point value, using
                  
    x       x    x ²  x ³  x⁴  
   e  = 1 + -- + -- + -- + -- + ...
            1!   2!   3!   4! 

   by adding up the expressions until the sum doesn't change anymore

   Recall that n! denotes the factorial function applied to n,
   i.e., n! = 1*2*3...*n, 0! = 1

   Examples:

     myexp(0)   = 1
     myexp(1)   = 2.7182... ~ e
     myexp(-1)  = 0.3678... ~ 1/e
                               _
     myexp(0.5) = 1.6487... ~ √e

   In function main() provide code to test your function.
   You can't use functions from math.h
