I hereby acknowledge the following sources that helped me finish this
assignment (fellow students, TAs, books, internet, ...) and how they
contributed:

The "Redirecting the Output" section of the Linux Tutorial in the course page.
The playlist in youtube "Learning to Program in C" by Jonathan Engelsma was referenced several times and was very helpful in making me understand the basics of C programming.
Most of the coding and debugging was done with the help of previous coding experience.
