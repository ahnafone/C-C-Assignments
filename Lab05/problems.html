CMPUT 201 (A1) Lab Exercise 5

Due: Friday Oct. 19, 22:00

Rules:

- IMPORTANT: You need to comment your code.  At least in front of every
  function and every loop, you need to put comments that explain the purpose
  of the function and how the loop works - in general terms. Also, there will
  be considerable mark deductions if the code is not formatted well. Comments
  and well formatted code help TAs with marking your submission

- You can use all course material and man pages, but you should be able to
  solve the problems below without web searches or communicating with other
  students. In the exams you will be asked to solve similar problems ...

- Your programs must compile without warning using

  g++ -Wall -Wextra -O ...

- In case your program hangs, use ctrl-c to terminate it.
  Use ctrl-d to terminate keyboard input to your programs

- In case your program hangs, use ctrl-c to terminate it.
  Use ctrl-d to terminate keyboard input to your programs

- Download README.txt and fill in the requested information

- Submit             README.txt string.h string.c makefile
  by the due date

- You can submit as often as you want. We will only consider the last
  submission for marking

============================================================================

You are given main.c, which contains test code for the functions you are
about to implement.

  A) [8 marks] In files string.h and string.c declare and implement the
     following string library functions:

     to_upper      // convert all characters in a string s 
                   // into upper case

       (E.g. to_upper transforms "1234foobar" into "1234FOOBAR"
        You may want to make use of C function toupper.)


     vowel_count   // returns the number of vowels in a string

       (a,e,i,o,u,A,E,I,O,U are vowels)

     empty         // returns true if and only if a string is empty


     print_os      // prints the operating system the application
                   // is compiled for:
                   // - if macro UNIX is defined, print UNIX to stdout,
                   // - else if macro WINDOWS is defined, print WINDOWS,
                   // - otherwise, print UNKNOWN

     Don't change main.c

     Comment, format, and test your code!


  B) [8 marks] Create a makefile for the project in A) with the following
     properties:

     - Make creates executable file str from files string.c and main.c
       using separate rules for generating .o files and linking

     - Paste dependencies generated by g++ -MM *.c into your makefile

     - In addition to the regular file dependencies, whenever the makefile is
       changed, all module files have to be re-compiled

     - There must be two lines that when uncommented either define macro UNIX
       or macro WINDOWS, in addition to the regular compiler flags we
       use. E.g.

# uncomment for UNIX code
CCOPTS :=  ...

# uncomment for WINDOWS code
#CCOPTS := ... 

       g++ must be invoked using variable CCOPTS

       After running make, if the makefile and your print_os implementation
       are correct, the output indicates which macro is set

     Consider starting with a makefile you've seen in the lectures or notes
     and massage it to this setting
