CMPUT 201 (A1) Lab Exercise 3

Due: Friday Oct 5, 22:00 via eClass

Rules:

- IMPORTANT: Starting with this lab exercise, you need to comment your code.
  At least in front of every function and every loop, you need to put comments
  that explain the purpose of the function and how the loop works - in general
  terms. Also, there will be considerable mark deductions if the code is not
  formatted well. Comments and well formatted code help TAs with marking your
  submission

- You may use all course material and man pages, but no other information such
  as web pages, books, or written notes. Using other information sources
  during the exercise constitues cheating

- Your programs must compile without warning using

  g++ -Wall -Wextra -O ...

- In case your program hangs, use ctrl-c to terminate it

- Download README.txt and fill in the requested information

- Submit             README.txt p1.c p2.c 
  by the due date

- You can submit as often as you want. We will only consider the last
  submission for marking

============================================================================

1) [8 marks] In file p1.c write a program that reads int values from standard
   input and prints two numbers when the end of file is reached: the smallest
   and biggest encountered value (which may be identical). In case anything
   other than integers appear in the input, the program needs to print
   "illegal input" and exit. If no number is provided, the output must be
   "empty input".

   Example:

   Input:

   1 3 0
     9 32 1 -1

   Output:
  
   -1 32

   Test your program with various inputs.
   Comment your code and format it well!

============================================================================

2) [8 marks] In file p2.c write a function closest_index that, given an array
   of points and a point p, returns the smallest index of a point in the array
   that is closest to p. Use assert to ensure that the array length is > 0.

   Use the following point struct:
    
     struct Point { double x, y; };

   and the Euclidean distance, which is defined as 
                      _________________________
                     /          ₂             ₂ 
       dist(p, q) = √(p.x - q.x) + (p.y - q.y)

   E.g. given an array containing the following points:

         (0, 1)  (1, 3)  (2, 4)  (-1, 0)

   and p = (1, 3.2), the function needs to return 1, which is the index
   of the point closest to p.
   
   In function main provide code to test your function. You may use
   function sqrt (include math.h), but perhaps you don't need to. 

   Comment your code and format it well!
