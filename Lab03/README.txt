I hereby acknowledge the following sources that helped me finish this
assignment (fellow students, TAs, books, internet, ...) and how they
contributed:

Most of my information was gathered from Google, from websites like stackoverflow etc. The information I gathered mostly regarding C-strings and it's functions. For example, I found the function strlen() from stackoverflow. Most of the algorithms however were derived from pure trial and error.
